# python-api-challenge-2

J. Savage Module 6 Challenge

In this challenge, I used an API to analyze a variety of weather data of a random group of cities. Using this information, I looked for correlations between latitude and various weather factors. Additionally, I used an API to locate hotels near different cities around the world that met my preferred weather conditions. I used this data to create a map to chart where the locations are and what the closest hotel is. My results and analysis can be found in my code.
